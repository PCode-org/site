# Change: Add Claude Code with ZAI Setup Guide to Related Software Installation

## Why

PCode users need comprehensive guidance on setting up Claude Code with the ZAI (智谱 AI) model, which is a popular domestic AI model provider. Currently, this content exists in an external repository (`Newbe.Pro`) but is not accessible in the PCode documentation site. Users seeking to configure Claude Code with ZAI cannot find official instructions within the PCode documentation.
