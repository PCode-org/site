# Change: Add First Project Creation Guide

**Status**: ExecutionCompleted

## Why

The Quick Start series currently has only one document (installation), leaving users without guidance on the next critical step: creating and configuring their first project in PCode. Users need a complete onboarding path from installation to their first working project.

## What Changes

- Add a second document to the Quick Start series: "Create Your First Project"
- Document the complete project creation workflow from repository preparation to OpenSpec initialization
- Cover project addition in PCode interface, OpenSpec initialization, and project.md optimization
- Provide bilingual content (English and Chinese) following existing documentation patterns

## Impact

- Affected specs: `docusaurus-site`
- Affected code:
  - `docs/quick-start/` - new `create-first-project.md` file
  - `i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/quick-start/` - new Chinese translation
  - `sidebars.ts` - no changes needed (autogenerated directory)
