## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Quick Start Project Creation Documentation

The Quick Start documentation series MUST include a comprehensive guide for creating and configuring the first project in PCode.

#### Scenario: Access project creation guide

**Given** the Quick Start category exists in the documentation
**When** a user navigates to the Quick Start section
**Then** a document titled "Create Your First Project" is available
**And** the document appears after the Installation guide in the sidebar order
**And** both English and Chinese versions are accessible

#### Scenario: Document covers complete workflow

**Given** the "Create Your First Project" document exists
**When** a user reads the document content
**Then** the document includes:
  - Step 1: Project preparation (Git repository requirements)
  - Step 2: Adding project in PCode interface (display name, repository URL)
  - Step 3: OpenSpec initialization (SDD Tab, initialization button)
  - Step 4: Optimizing project.md (when applicable, optimization button)
  - Step 5: Regular maintenance guidelines
**And** each step includes clear instructions and expected outcomes

#### Scenario: Chinese translation completeness

**Given** the English version of "Create Your First Project" exists
**When** the Chinese version is accessed at `i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/quick-start/create-first-project.md`
**Then** all English content is translated to Chinese
**And** technical terms are appropriately translated or kept in English where standard
**And** the document structure matches the English version
**And** proper Chinese frontmatter is included (title, description)

#### Scenario: Document follows markdown conventions

**Given** the `create-first-project.md` file exists
**When** the file is validated
**Then** the file uses kebab-case naming
**And** frontmatter includes `title` and `description` properties
**And** code blocks use appropriate syntax highlighting (bash, yaml, etc.)
**And** internal links use proper Docusaurus path format

#### Scenario: Integration with existing Quick Start

**Given** the Quick Start series already contains an installation guide
**When** the project creation guide is added
**Then** the document appears in the same Quick Start category
**And** no changes to `sidebars.ts` are required (autogenerated directory)
**And** the document is automatically included in navigation
**And** a reference to the next step (project creation) exists in installation guide if applicable
