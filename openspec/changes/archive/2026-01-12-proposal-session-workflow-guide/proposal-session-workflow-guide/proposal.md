# Change: Add Proposal Session Workflow Guide

**Status**: ExecutionCompleted

## Why

The fourth Quick Start guide is needed to complete the getting-started series for PCode users. After learning about installation, project creation, and conversation sessions, users need to understand how to use Proposal Sessions (Idea Sessions) - the core feature that transforms abstract ideas into executable code through OpenSpec's structured workflow.

Currently, users may:
- Understand basic conversation sessions but lack knowledge of the proposal lifecycle
- Not know how to navigate the 9-stage state machine (0-8)
- Be unclear about which stages are AI-automatic vs. user-manual
- Not understand the annotation system (inline, file, global)
- Lack clear expectations about when to use proposal sessions vs. conversation sessions

## What Changes

- Add new Quick Start guide: `docs/quick-start/proposal-session.md` ✅
- Add Chinese translation: `i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/quick-start/proposal-session.md` ✅
- Document the complete 9-stage proposal session lifecycle (State 0-8) ✅
- Explain AI-automatic stages (1, 3, 5, 7) vs. user-manual stages (0, 2, 4, 6) ✅
- Detail the three-tier annotation system (inline, file, global) ✅
- Describe the conversation mode difference (edit mode in State 6) ✅
- Provide state transition reference table ✅
- Link to next steps after proposal completion ✅

## UI Design Changes

None - this is documentation-only change.

## Code Flow Changes

None - this is documentation-only change.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `docusaurus-site`
- New files created:
  - `docs/quick-start/proposal-session.md` ✅
  - `i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/quick-start/proposal-session.md` ✅
- No code changes required
- No build configuration changes
- Documentation will auto-appear in sidebar due to `autogenerated` configuration

## Execution Summary

All tasks completed:
- Created comprehensive English documentation covering all 9 proposal session states
- Created complete Chinese translation maintaining structure parity
- Documentation follows existing style patterns in the codebase
- Files will appear automatically in sidebar via `autogenerated` configuration

**Note**: Build verification shows pre-existing broken links to missing Chinese translations for other documentation files (not related to this change). The new files are syntactically valid and will render correctly.
