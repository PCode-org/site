## Context

The PCode documentation site currently uses Docusaurus with a multi-category structure. The site supports internationalization (English and Chinese) with corresponding translation files. The documentation structure is defined in `sidebars.ts` which uses `autogenerated` directory entries.

**Current State:**
- Multiple documentation categories: Quick Start, Installation, Feature Guides, Configuration, User Guide
- Bilingual support (en, zh-CN)
- Autogenerated sidebar navigation based on directory structure
- Footer links in `docusaurus.config.ts` referencing some deleted sections

**Constraints:**
- Must preserve Quick Start documentation (both English and Chinese)
- Must ensure build continues to work after changes
- Docusaurus `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` means missing references will cause build failure

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Simplify documentation to a single Quick Start section
- Remove all unnecessary documentation files
- Update navigation configuration to reflect simplified structure
- Ensure successful build after changes

**Non-Goals:**
- Modifying Quick Start content (keep as-is)
- Changing internationalization configuration
- Redesigning the site layout or theme

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Directory Deletion Approach

**Choice:** Delete entire directories rather than individual files

**Rationale:**
- Simpler and less error-prone
- Docusaurus uses `autogenerated` sidebar entries based on directories
- Ensures no orphaned files remain

**Alternatives considered:**
- Individual file deletion: More granular but higher risk of missing files
- Keep directories empty: Would still show in navigation

### Decision 2: Sidebar Configuration

**Choice:** Use simplified hardcoded items instead of `autogenerated`

**Rationale:**
- More explicit control over navigation
- Prevents future accidental directory additions
- Clearer documentation structure

**New `sidebars.ts` structure:**
```typescript
docsSidebar: [
  {
    type: 'category',
    label: 'Quick Start',
    link: {
      type: 'generated-index',
      title: 'Quick Start',
      description: 'Get started with PCode quickly',
      slug: '/quick-start',
    },
    items: [
      {
        type: 'autogenerated',
        dirName: 'quick-start',
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

### Decision 3: Footer Link Updates

**Choice:** Remove Installation and Feature Guides from footer

**Rationale:**
- These sections will no longer exist
- Footer links should point to valid documentation

**Alternative considered:**
- Replace Quick Start link: Current footer doesn't have Quick Start link, could add one

## File Structure Changes

### Files to Delete

**English Documentation (`docs/`):**
```
docs/
├── installation/          (DELETE)
├── feature-guides/        (DELETE - entire directory)
│   ├── session-management/
│   ├── conversation/
│   ├── project-management/
│   ├── openspec/
│   ├── statistics/
│   └── achievements/
├── configuration/         (DELETE)
├── user-guide/           (DELETE - entire directory)
│   ├── appearance/
│   └── settings/
└── contributing.md        (DELETE)
```

**Chinese Translations (`i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`):**
```
i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/
├── installation/          (DELETE)
├── feature-guides/        (DELETE - entire directory)
├── configuration/         (DELETE)
└── user-guide/           (DELETE - entire directory)
```

### Files to Preserve

```
docs/
└── quick-start/          (PRESERVE)

i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/
└── quick-start/          (PRESERVE)
```

### Files to Modify

```
sidebars.ts               (SIMPLIFY)
docusaurus.config.ts      (UPDATE footer links)
```

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk 1: Broken Links in External References

**Risk:** External sites or bookmarks may link to deleted documentation pages

**Mitigation:**
- Docusaurus `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` will catch any internal links
- Use HTTP redirects if needed (requires web server configuration)
- Document the change in release notes

### Risk 2: Loss of Documentation Content

**Risk:** Deleted documentation may be needed in the future

**Mitigation:**
- Git history preserves all content
- Can restore from `git log` or specific commits
- Tag release before deletion for easy rollback

### Risk 3: Build Failure

**Risk:** Missing configuration updates may cause build to fail

**Mitigation:**
- Run `npm run build` after changes
- Verify `onBrokenLinks` doesn't trigger
- Test locally before deploying

## Migration Plan

**Steps:**
1. Create backup commit before deletion
2. Delete directories in order (English docs, then translations)
3. Update configuration files
4. Run build to validate
5. Test site navigation

**Rollback:**
- Git revert to backup commit if issues arise
- Content can be restored from git history selectively

## Open Questions

None identified - this is a straightforward documentation simplification.
